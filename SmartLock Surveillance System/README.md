# SmartLock Surveillance System
- SmartLock Surveillance System is a web-based platform that incorporates IoT devices to control the door state (open or close) by clicking a button. It also features surveillance capabilities using an ESP32cam camera, an accelerometer for detecting vibrations, and a proximity sensor to monitor entry and exit events at a clinic.

## Scope
- The primary objective of this project is to provide a user-friendly web-based interface.
- The system is designed to serve a single specific user.

## Limitations
- The system does not include facial recognition capabilities.
- It lacks a feature to automatically save video recordings when vibration exceeds a certain threshold.
- The system does not have the capability to contact the nearest police station in case of emergencies.

## Tools Used
- Arduino
- ESP32
- 2 ESP32Cam cameras
- Proximity Sensors
- Firebase for Authentication and Realtime Database
- Bootstrap
